# RIDL-bench

Benchmarking tools for testing RIDL across different privilege boundaries.

This was an early attempt to test a data channel over the following boundaries:
- User-User
- Kernel-User
- VM-User
- SGX-User

Look at ```run.py``` for how to set up benchmarking.
You can download the required VM image using the provided `download.sh` script.

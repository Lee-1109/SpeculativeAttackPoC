This is one of the debug/test suites which was used for investigating TAA
when writing the RIDL paper.

It was shared with Intel on May 10th, 2019 (as alyssaleak2).

It has not been updated since October 2018 (when we submitted the RIDL
paper), so the comments probably don't make sense. Of course, the code also
doesn't make sense either, which is why we have tidied-up PoCs elsewhere. :)

Note that if you add mitigations after the NO_STORE_SECRET block, you might
want to disable flushing the secret, to make sure the flush isn't leaking.
